09:10:45 Young KIM:  ... also we want to say, it goes pretty  quick, so, these championships go by quick, so --  keep up, and it will go by
09:10:56 >> Greta:  The best time to take advantage of those  advisory resources is beginning of the quarter.  If  you are going to TA office ours
09:11:02 the entire class will  try to do that, we encourage you to start early.
09:11:08 >> We are going to shift gear and move to academic  planning questions.
09:11:19 >> Lindy:  I want to make a comment that we have a  closed captioner in class the students need it they  can access the
09:11:22 captioning now.
09:11:26 >> Greta:  Can you give a note on how to access?
09:11:37 >> Lindy:  At the bottom of the scream there's a  closed captioning CC image and if you click on that  you have the options to view.
09:11:53 >> Greta:  When will I be able to create a  four-year -- is there a specific template or using  the academic planning form?
09:12:04 >> Monique:  Generally our advisers don't assist  students with four-year plans, but I will explain  how you can receive help from our
09:12:13 office, our peer advisers  can assist you with the first two years of the plan,  up to the quarter you are ready to declare,
09:12:25 usually  the student's sixth quarter.  You can go peer  adviser chat hours.  A link to their hours was  included in the presentation
09:12:36 that was e-mailed to everyone.  We  ask you wait a couple weeks from now before going to  them to help with plans.
09:12:50 >> Generally the first two weeks of fall are pretty  hectic and the peers are busy helping all students,  with very urgent items related
09:12:58 to the beginning of the  academic year, but then you are welcome to go to  them for planning.
09:13:10 >> We suggest you try to put together your own  two-year plan first, then once you have done that  the peer advisers can look over
09:13:26 your plan and make changes if  needed.  The peer advisers can help with the plan  for the first two years, then for assistance
09:13:36 on the remainder  of the plan you will receive guidance from a staff  adviser once you go through the declaration of major
09:13:48 page  process.  At the end of a student's second year.   The answer to the second part of this question  related to the academic planning
09:14:08 form, there is  no  engineering-specific planning form.  The link to the  forms can be found in the How to Plan document.
09:14:14 >> So check out that link.
09:14:23 >> Greta:  Also for you are there resources  outlining a third-year schedule so students know  what the schedule will look like in their
09:14:30 later half of  their college careers?
09:14:40 >> Monique:  Definitely yes.  As I mentioned  earlier, included in the presentation sent was a  link to a website on how to make an academic
09:14:56 plan.  This website  will walk you through step-by-step and there are  also templates in the E CSC general catalog.  To  find
09:15:09 plans in the catalog, go to your major and look for  your requirements and planners, they can, once you  get to that place, then the
09:15:18 plans can be found by scrolling  to the end of that page.  Thesers include plans for  the entire four years.
09:15:27 >> The planners can help with the first two years as  well but keep in mind these plans in the general  catalog are templates,
09:15:38 >> So you may need to adjust to fit your individual  situation.  Once you go through the declaration of  major process, or as a part of that
09:15:45 process a staff adviser  will review your major plan for your final years.
09:15:56 >> Greta:  We know this is a lot of information.  We  are recording these resources, the presentation, so  you have the ability to refer back
09:16:06 and you don't need to  remember everything as we are discussing it.  What  is the process to double major in biomolecular lar
09:16:13 engineering and if I was a computer science major?
09:16:31 >> Young Kim:  Admitted as computer science --  another story, two different majors is not  considered computer science, but
09:16:47 answering this  question, computer science, wants to add on to  biomolecular engineering, the student needs to  qualify for both
09:17:03 majors, but the thing is, you need to  identify one major.  The worst thing one could do is  try to complete both and you only completed
09:17:16 complete half of  one and half of the other, so we want to say you can  pursue double major, you need to qualify for both  majors
09:17:31 >> We have -- [indiscernible] but I want to point  out that you want to complete, identify one,  complete it fully, because like I said, the
09:17:39 >> Worst thing, you only complete half of one, half  the other and can't declare either,
09:18:08 >> Greta:  We ask you start submitting questions, I  think we are moving at a pretty good pace, probably  will be able to get to those,
09:18:13 but hold off until we ask you  to submit more.
09:18:23 >> Another question for you, engineering majors with  AP credit, tests, can it count for our major?
09:18:41 >> Young Kim:  AP, a B-C should -- [indiscernible]  whatever score you got on the AP exam, whatever you  got credit for means that you
09:18:53 have enough knowledge, our  faculty are confident you can move to the next  level.  Please note if you score -- math, right,
09:19:09 you  move to the next level, I point out we have a lot of  engineering students who are taking the physics AP,  please note that if you
09:19:22 receive -- the credit for the  course, however, you will eventually need to take  the lab, so you got the course, but there's a lab  portion
09:19:35 for  the physics the AP doesn't cover for.  So if you got  5, that counts to our physics 5A, but not the L or  the lab itself.
09:19:45 >> , students in this situation need to complete the  lab eventually.  This is important for computer  engineering majors, robotics,
09:19:57 electrical engineering  and network and data technology.  Those majors, you  will eventually have to take the courses, if you
09:20:03 took AP,  you need to take the lab.
09:20:15 >> Greta:  Thank you.  Another for you and then I  prom I you can have a break, can you take a major  qualification ourselves at a community college
09:20:24 commune will that go  towards my -- and receive credit?
09:20:41 >> Young KIM:  You can, at community college, think  about it, math is math, wherever you take it.  You  can take it at MIT or
09:21:04 just make sure the courses are related  to UCSC, articulated -- please note the key word is  grade, one question Greta saids,
09:21:16 the grade, your  community college grade, courses at community  college don't carry over the grade to UCSC GPA.
09:21:32 >> In a nutshell means you are taking courses at  UCSC, whatever you take outside UCSC is not  incorporating into -- if you need to
09:21:44 appeal, you need to  submit all transcripts taken outside UCSC and those  grades and courses will be taken into consideration.
09:21:55 >> Greta:  Thank you.  Monique, next question is for  you.  If I take courses for my major in the summer  session will those courses
09:22:00 count towards my major?
09:22:11 Monique:   Definitely.
09:22:34 >> Greta:  We have a question about if this applies  to game design as well, if include that in your  answer.
09:22:45 >> Andrea:  A great clarification, thanks for  asking, computer science has a formal impact, status  with the university,
09:23:07 students not accepted -- the  process -- campus -- the case, similar major,  computer engineering or computer science,
09:23:18 don't fall  under this policy.  If you would like to request a  change of proposed major to any non-computer --
09:23:32 >> There is a form you can fill out.  You can get to  that form by going to tiny URL.com/proposed  BS O E all one word together.
09:23:40 >> That took time to proposed major to be updated  but will happen if you fill that form out.
09:23:51 >> Greta:  Thank you.  If I declare the computer  science bachelor of arts can I switch to the  Bachelor of Science?
09:24:07 >> It Andrea:  All students are accepted in   cocomputer science can -- if you declare the BA,  want to switch to the BS later you need to
09:24:19 >> File to do so but from the BS to BA after you  declared 9BS you just need to inform your adviser  you want to switch to BA.
09:24:30 >> # it would be recommended to talk to your adviser  if you are unsure of the two majors.  It's easier to  go one direction than the other.
09:24:38 >> Greta:  We will shift to cover the proposed major  policy.  Monique, question for you.
09:24:46 >> If students do not meet the proposed major policy  will they be removed from the major?
09:24:55 >> Monique:  Yes, students who don't meet the policy  will be removed from the major, however, will are a  chance to appeal.
09:25:01 >> If the appeal is denied students need to identify  and work towards an alternate major.
09:25:15 >> Also, one thing to note, students who don't  satisfy the three foundation classes during the  first three quarters are encouraged
09:25:24 encourage to take a summer  class to get you back on track and conditionally  approved.  Recalls just so everyone knows,
09:25:36 knows,our  office  is spending out more information within the next  week, look for it in your e-mail in-box.
09:25:47 >> Greta:  Andrea, what if I am unable to complete  the three foundation classes by the third quarter  because of not
09:25:55 placing high enough on math placement to  enroll in fall quarter?
09:26:04 >> Andrea:  You will want to take whatever math  course you place into as soon as possible and mutual  forward as you can.
09:26:13 >> Move forward.  There's an April process at the  end of the first year, you can invest in an appeal.
09:26:20 >> Also, touching on, summer classes can help if  that's an option for you.  What's really important  is you are focused on classing
09:26:32 class that will help in your  major, satisfying the prerequisites for that, rather  than taking classes focusing on the policy.
09:26:38 >> This policy is many the to keep you on track, not  [indiscernible] anyway.
09:26:53 >> Greta:  We are shifting to major qualification  questions.  If a student fails a class will they be  removed from the major or just be
09:26:57 delayed?
09:27:23 Young Kim:  You get  one chance you can mess up, if you need to, want to,  but yes, seven units is a minimum of the -- that
09:27:27 the you are  allowed for.
09:27:36 >> Is Greta:  Andrea, classes should I be taking to  qualify for a major by the six quarter?
09:27:47 >> Had Andrea:  First five quarters are focused on  meeting qualification requirements for major.  This  list, clearly on our major
09:27:57 qualification that will be  available on the website very soon, definitely  before you need to fill out classes for -- if you  are eager to see
09:28:15 this the major requirement are in the  UCSC general catalog.  We want to make sure you look  at the catalog that says 2020/21
09:28:25 >> Greta:  What if you finish foundation courses  earlier than the six quarter time limit?
09:28:29 >> Andrea:  You want to declare your major as soon  as you possibly can.
09:28:41 >> Greta:  Thank you.  Monique, is there specific  order in which we need to take courses selected from  the required list?
09:28:58 Monique:  Yes, there's general an  order.  Most classes have prerequisites, you have to  pay attention to these.  The
09:29:09 prerequisites are included in  the general catalog, find them by clicking on the  actual course in the catalog.  The other thing that
09:29:23 you must  pay attention to, when classes are offered, because  not all of our classes are offered every quarter.   You can check when
09:29:42 school of engineering classes are offered by  going to courses. -- the website, schedule for  classes in non-- those can be
09:29:50 found on individual  department websites and the how to plan link  included in the presentation.
09:30:01 >> Greta:  Will summer quarter count towards the  number of quarters we have taken?
09:30:16 >> Young:  All freshmen students, sixth quarter --  we really talk about your summer at the end of first  year, this spring, then summer,
09:30:27 then another three  quarters, that summer does not technically count as  a full quarter.  You can take advantage of taking  your summer
09:30:37 here or at your local community college.  If it  does not count as a quarter, but part of that  question, I want to clarify, is that
09:30:50 end of the sixth  quarter, right, technically you need to have all  your main courses completed by end of your fifth  quarter,
09:31:04 quart winter here, we need the finals completed to  start the process of declaration beginning of sixth  quarter.
09:31:22 >> The thing about, the question, true -- but -- I  want to add that you need to be completed by --  restart the beginning of your sixth quart
09:31:49 quarter, so  yes, to answer the question, summer quarter or -- does  not count towards your quarter but you need to  complete major
09:31:52 page
09:32:01 >> Greta:  Will I be able to complete in four years  or less.
09:32:01 >> ?
09:32:18 >> Andrea:  Yes, definitely, involving many factors,  when you start your major, how carefully you plan,  whether summer courses are an
09:32:31 option, every quarter where  you -- sequencing.  You want to think about whether  racing to degree requirements, trying to race
09:32:41 through reduce  the amount of opportunities for internships, that  you want to take advantage of.
09:32:55 of.Greta:  Some odds and  ends questions, what are criteria to the five-years  master's program?
09:33:11 >> Monique:  All advising for five-year master's  programs in the school of engineering is the  BS O E advising office, to find the criteria for  add
09:33:22 >> Is admission, you should check out with them.   Although the names are different, they all  essentially mean the same thing.
09:33:41 >> The graduate advising office has information  listed on each contiguous program on their website  at grad.BS O E, scroll down to contiguous pathways  or
09:33:43 >>
09:33:48 >> Greta:  Next question, regarding our weekly  newsletter.
09:34:01 >> The weekly newsletter is something I can  subscribe to, get updates or simply a web page I  must get to get the latest news?
09:34:15 >> Is Monique:  We will automatically add you to it,  you can read the news, by the way, students will be  added this week.
09:34:28 >> It will come right to your e-mail in-box or you  can access it by going to the BS O E advising  website at undergrads.--
09:34:37 >> Once there you scroll down to the bottom of the  page and click on the picture with the title  newsletter.
09:34:46 >> That concludes the questions submitted ahead of  time.  We will be opening up the questions to the  general Q&A feature.
09:34:49 >> I wanted to reiterate terms on the questions.
09:35:00 >> If we don't -- we are not answering questions of  a personal student-specific situation.  We will not  answer questions not ours to
09:35:09 answer, this is general  education requirementsor specific content of the  courses, that kind of thing.
09:35:18 >> I know the summer orientation leaders are  available to help students transition through fall  quarter.  I know they also have
09:35:30 available chat hours and I  encourage you to utilize these resources.  But we  are not covering specific areas of questions.
09:35:38 >> If there are questions we haven't answered by the  time this webinar concludes at 10, we will include  them on our website
09:35:44 when we add the recorded link of this  presentation.
09:36:00 >> Monique, can you give a brief answer to this  question of who you contact when you need help in  general with your educational
09:36:07 requirements?
09:36:14 >> Monique:  Specifically, general education  requirements?
09:36:17 >> # Greta:  Interaction to college resources.
09:36:34 >> Monique:  Those type questions should go to your  college academic adviser and a list of advisers and  contact information can be found
09:36:44 I believe, I don't  remember the URL for that site but if you Google  college advising UCSC you should be able to get it.
09:36:51 >> Greta:  Thank you, shout out in the chat from  Jennifer.
09:37:16 >> Greta:  If someone is accepted to -- can they  major in
09:37:27 >> Young:  That'sate loaded, if you want to double  major or switch, either of those situations to  computer science,
09:37:41 this is a situation I hesitate -- not my  division, computer science is considered an  [indiscernible] status, means you want to major
09:37:58 page in  computer science you apply way back in November, on  an application in order to be considered for  computer science here.
09:38:10 Having said that, the student  who originally put electrical engineering way back  in November is now a Slug here,
09:38:21 >> Unfortunately the policy states students are  unable to pursue computer science if they were not  proposed computer science
09:38:35 compute originally.  I am deeply sorry,  with regret, yeah, you are unable to pursue computer  science, but there are many other majors
09:38:48 we offer.   That would be very good for your education, your  future, so to answer your question, unfortunately  you are not age to add --
09:39:01 >> But I will flip that, bioengineering,  biomolecular and bioinformatics engineering, if the  student was proposed computer science,
09:39:15 and want to add later  on different things, different story, they apply on  the application, proposed computer science and --  students
09:39:26 are able to add or switch to another major, but the  student, electrical engineering proposed, if you do  not apply as computer
09:39:34 computer science you cannot switch.
09:39:45 >> Greta:  In general terms, touching on light  academic programming, but what is the best sequence  for CS E 12, 13, 16, 30?
09:39:56 >> Andrea:  The first thing I will say any this is,  ideally, don't take CS E 12 if you do not have any  programming experience.
09:40:06 >> I feel like it's something that is pretty  important to reiterate.  Something about that class  is deceiving.  It doesn't have
09:40:20 prerequisites attached except some  programming, it lends to people feeling like, okay,  I will be fine.  You definitely need to have a  little
09:40:32 bit of  programming knowledge.  That said, I definitely   think either direction is probably okay.  The more  programming experience you have
09:40:44 is good, ideally take CS  is E 30 before CS E 12, don't stack the programming  courses on top of one another.
09:40:59 >> Taking 12 and 30, and then also one note, CSE 16  is primarily more of a math course.  In terms of  that course not thinking as much as
09:41:05 programming.  And 13  goes after 12.
09:41:14 >> Greta:  We are getting notes here about our  maximum capacity being 500 students.  We apologize,  we thought that would be larger,
09:41:25 large but we are still  working out kinks of virtual advising, the recording  of this webinar, we hope to have available by the
09:41:34 end of  the week on the website and will let students have  more information about that.  It is what it is,  unfortunately,
09:41:46 but it did.  Young, this is for you,  do you recommend joining engineering clubs freshman  year?
09:42:00 >>Young:  Definitely.  I will answer this  question, but that person named Jennifer Webb, be a  good resource.
09:42:07 >> She will explain why, run with it, catch the ball  and run.
09:42:28 >> JENNIFER:  I caught the ball, I am running.   Definitely you want to get involved in clubs.   There are so many reasons why.
09:42:40 >> You will connect to so many people, you will find  people to study with, super important, right?  As  you go through your career,
09:42:51 DA hit junior, sophomore year,  lots of opportunities you might not find elsewhere,  getting connected with industry, leaders,
09:43:01 people who  work in the fields you want to go into, they contact  the clubs to present at club meetings, you want to  connect for that
09:43:12 as well.  Opportunities for internships,  research, special events happening, so that kind of  thing is super important.
09:43:22 >> As you hit senior year you already are in these  clubs, you know people who have now graduated  because you were a freshman in a
09:43:33 club with a senior, they  are part of your professional network.  When they  find out about jobs available in their workplace  they will come
09:43:40 back to the club and say -- definitely join the  club.  Join the clubs!
09:43:46 >> There are lots of great clubs available.  I will  put some of that in the chat to keep the Q&A going.
09:43:48 >> Greta:  Thank you.
09:44:01 >> Young:  That thing about student work, virtual  meeting later on, so mentioned -- leaders, doing a  webinar at noon today.
09:44:09 >> Is I don't have too much information about that,  but Lindy, another staff member wanted you and -- to  know there's
09:44:22 >> Some kind of -- must be somewhere on orientation  about a webinar for student leaders, you can ask  questions, inquire about how
09:44:30 to join engineering student  organization.  We have engineering organization and  they are very important, there are a variety
09:44:45 of  non-engineering clubs available at UCSC, I would  have to refer you -- student organization,  something -- resources, sorry --
09:44:53 >> I should know that, but that's where you can  inquire about joining non-engineering organization.
09:45:19 Monique:   [indiscernible] should be available in less than two  weeks, by the week of October 12.
09:45:27 >> Is so please visit our website by then, that --  October 12, they should all be available.
09:45:41 >> Andrea, to you, we have a couple questions about  minors,ment to know if there are restrictions to the  computer science
09:45:49 >> If there's a quarter to declare the minor, what  does -- touch what the process for declaring a  minor.
09:46:03 >> Andrea:  There are not restrictions.  Anyone can  declare any particular minor with one exception,  that is that you must be
09:46:15 declared in your major before  you can be declared in your minor.  This is probably  not as critical, if you are in this webinar as
09:46:26 someone  doing an engineering major, but if you are thinking  of engineering minor, doing something like a math  major,
09:46:41 >> Wanted to add a computer science minor, a lot of  minors don't lend themselves well to condensed  course work, cramming in
09:46:53 in the last year so if you are  not doing a minor in a similar field you probably  want to -- you can declare up to the point you  graduate,
09:47:03 you  want to do careful planning to spread the course  work out if your major is not closely related to  the --
09:47:13 >> Greta:  Young, we addressed this earlier but  questions to address, can you talk about AP credit  again?
09:47:20 >> Going into the GPA or posted on student accounts.
09:47:47 Young:  AP, AB math 45 will get you out of -- AC --  will get you out of math -- so that means, faculty  and people here evaluate
09:48:03 if you -- confident students  can  move forward to the next level.  If you make the cut  you are able to do math 23A or, some have
09:48:16 the option of A and  30.  Having said that, the GPA or how that factors  in, AP coursing aren't really tied to a GPA.
09:48:30 >> UCSC GPA is only if you take at UCSC.  You worked  hard, took courses way back at the high school  level, those GPA
09:48:43 GP don't factor into our GPAs here,  your proposed major or qualification.  They don't  count, but you did hard work.
09:48:52 >> They allow you to move forward to the next level.   When will they be posted?  From my understanding,  once you submit your scores,
09:49:06 you trips from the  registrars, one of the people -- posted to other  credits on the portal, if you are having issues with  getting
09:49:19 get into the next-level course or verify you have  taken the AP or college courses, I will say this --  maybe you are doing it wrong,
09:49:36 but if you want to  e-mail us with your score, we will have to -- have  to own up to it -- over to me -- my other staff, we  can manually
09:49:52 enter those scores into your prerequisite  credits to allow you to enroll in your next step.
09:50:04 >> Greta:  Monique, next question for you.  What  should I do if I am still on the wait list on first  day of classes?
09:50:18 >> Monique:  You should make sure and attend the  class.  If you don't attend the class there's a  possibility if room becomes available
09:50:26 you won't be able to be  that -- make sure to attend the first session of  that course.
09:50:37 >> Greta:  We are at 10 minutes, so definitely not  going to be answering all these questions but we  appreciate you are sending them in.
09:50:53 >> Back to a lot of referring to the website, under  grad.S O E .-- where you will find major  qualification, resource to all the student
09:50:58 engineering orgs,  more information for them as well.
09:51:11 >> We have a lot of remaining questions that are  relating to things we already covered.  One thing  noted, asking why isn't
09:51:21 math 21A and B on the course  offerings, these are outside the school of  engineering, cannot answer that.  Engineering majors
09:51:33 should plan on taking math 19A and B.  We will take  questions for about another five minutes.  If we  can't answer, sorry, but
09:51:44 we will answer as many as we  can.  Andrea, benefits of declaring early?
09:52:01 Andrea:   Especially for computer science, even for other  majors one benefit of course is that some classes  have restrictions on them
09:52:18 you get priority if you  are a declared major.  In addition, a few times in  passing as we talked about academic planning and  being
09:52:29 prepared to move forward, it's an opportunity to get  to the point of graduation.
09:52:40 >> Greta:  Monique, how many classes should we  take each quarter?
09:52:52 >> Monique:  Typically three classes a quarter is  the general rule we advise students to take.  Of  those three we recommend that you only
09:53:05 take two in your  major and the third class be a course outside your  major.  The first-year student, particularly, that  means you will
09:53:18 you be enrolled in your college core, the two  other courses can be in your major and throughout  the first or -- actually, the
09:53:35 rest of your time at UCSC,  keep that ratio of when GE or outside the school of  engineering once you complete your GEs, and
09:53:47 the other two  can be in your major.  It's difficult to take more  than two classes in your major, classes in the  school of engineering
09:53:56 are pretty rigorous.  We don't advise  students to take three classes in the major.
09:54:10 >> Greta:  Thank you.  What is the difference  between major requirements and major qualification?
09:54:29 >> Monique:  Major requirements are all the courses  that you need to take for your major.  That's  everything that is on the curriculum chart
09:54:43 we have been  referring to, curriculum chart can be found on the  undergraduate advising website.  If you go to  undergrad.S Oe.--
09:54:54 >> Look for major requirements, that's where you  find all of these charts that include all of the  required courses for each program
09:55:09 in the school of  engineering, all the classes required.  Major  qualification stands for the classings required for  you to be able to
09:55:19 todeclare or get in the major you  intend to pursue.  For example, usually a smaller  set of courses.
09:55:34 >> One example is for computer science, correct me  if I am wrong, but we require at least five classes  in order to qualify.
09:55:50 >> If you look at the major conversation requirement  chart on the website, those charts indicate exactly  what those courses are
09:56:00 in order qualify for your  intended major.
09:56:11 >> Greta:  I wanted to conclude on different topics,  still questions in the chat regarding wait list,  textbooks.  For classes in the
09:56:25 class school of engineering most  faculty have been instructed to send out first day  of class information to the class list  and wait  list.
09:56:37 >> There are questions on how are we going to answer  the remaining questions, e-mailing or website?  We  are not going to e-mail them.
09:56:44 >> You will get plenty of e-mails, don't want to  over flood it, it will be on the website.
09:56:57 website.  We will  get the recording, answers to questions up by the  end of this week.  We appreciate everywhere's  patience during this process.
09:57:08 >> There are also a few other questions about what  we are talking about when referring to the three  foundation classes,
09:57:14 >> You will be getting an e-mail with more  information about that following this presentation.
09:57:22 >> Had please keep those questions to that e-mail,  you will read through it, there will be more  specific information about what counts
09:57:31 count and does not  count as a major foundation course.  Thank you for  joining us on a 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday morning.
09:57:39 >> We know you are very busy on welcome week, and  hope you enjoy your other event and welcome to fall  quarter.
09:57:42 >> We will end the meeting shortly.
